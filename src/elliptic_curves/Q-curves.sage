r"""A class for working with $\Q$-curves

A $\Q$-curve is an elliptic curve defined over some number field that
is isogenous to all its galois conjugates. This file contains the
class Qcurve that represents $\Q$-curves that do not have complex
multiplication.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-2)
    sage: Qcurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(t + 1), 0], isogenies={s : (-t, 2)})
    Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 12*x^2 + (18*t+18)*x over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 + 2

Q-curves without CM are modular and are linked to classical newforms
that can be computed::

    sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(3)
    sage: E = Qcurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(1 + t), 0], guessed_degrees=[2])
    sage: E2 = E.decomposable_twist()
    sage: E2.newform() # long
    (q + (-a + 1)*q^3 + a*q^5 + 3*a*q^7 + (-2*a - 1)*q^9 + 4*q^11 + O(q^12),
     [Dirichlet character modulo 12 of conductor 1 mapping 7 |--> 1, 5 |--> 1])

    r"""A Q-curve over some number field

    A Q-curve is an elliptic curve defined over some number field,
    such that all its galois conjugates are isogeneous to the curve
    itself.

    In this class a Q-curve is represented as an elliptic curve E
    defined over a galois number field K, together with for each
    element s of the galois group of K a tuple containing the scalar
    and degree associated to the isogeny from s(E) to E.

    .. NOTE::

    This class is intended for Q-curves without complex
    multiplication. Although Q-curves with complex multiplication
    might work, the theory behind many of the methods in this class
    was only intended for Q-curves without complex multiplication.

        sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-2)
        sage: Qcurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(t + 1), 0], isogenies={s : (-t, 2)})

        Will build all data associated to a Q-curve in the following
        way.
        
        First of all will initialize the curve itself by using either
        a given curve or by data that can be turned into a curve using
        the function EllipticCurve. The resulting curve should be
        defined over some number field and will be redefined over the
        galois closure of this field.
        
        Next it will compute all the galois conjugates of itself with
        respect to the galois group of its base field.

        Third it will fill in data about the isogenies from a galois
        conjugate to itself using the provided data given.

        Next it will determine the remaining isogenies using the
        guessed degrees and combining previously found isogenies.
        
        If in this way it can not find isogenies from each galois
        conjugate to itself, the initialization will produce an error
        and the resulting object should not be used.

        INPUT:
        
         - ``curve`` -- An elliptic curve over some number field or
           any input that would create such a curve when passed to the
           constructor EllipticCurve. This curve will be taken over
           the minimal galois extension of its base field. It should
           be defined by a Weierstrass equation of the form .. MATH:

              Y^2 = X^3 + a2*X^2 + a4*X + a6

         - ``isogenies`` -- A dictionary (default: {}) with as keys
           elements of the galois group of the base field of the
           Q-curve and as values data of the corresponding isogeny
           from the galois conjugate of this Q-curve to itself. This
           data can be either an isogeny as a Sage object or a tuple
           of an algebraic integer (defined as an element of some
           number field) and a strictly positive integer, which are
           respectively the $\lambda$ such that the isogeny is $z
           \mapsto \lambda z$ on the complex numbers and the degree of
           the isogeny.

        - ``guessed_degrees`` -- A list (default: []) of strictly
           positive integers indicating possible degrees of isogenies
           from galois conjugates of this curve to itself.

        - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer (default:
           False). When set to True or any value larger then zero will
           print comments to stdout about the computations being done
           whilst busy. If set to False or 0 will not print such
           comments. If set to any negative value will also prevent
           the printing of any warnings. A higher value will cause
           more messages to be printed.

        EXAMPLES:

        One can create a Qcurve using an explicit isogeny::

            sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-2)
            sage: G.<s> = K.galois_group()
            sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(t + 1), 0])
            sage: Es = EllipticCurve([s(a) for a in E.a_invariants()])
            sage: phi = Es.isogeny(Es([0,0]), codomain=E)
            sage: Qcurve(E, isogenies={s : phi})
            Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 12*x^2 + (18*t+18)*x over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 + 2

        However, it is sufficient to simply provide the scalar and the
        degree of the isogeny::

            sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-2)
            sage: Qcurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(t + 1), 0], isogenies={s : (-t, 2)})
            Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 12*x^2 + (18*t+18)*x over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
        
        It is also possible to make the code 'guess' the isogenies by
        giving a suggestion for their degree::
        
            sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(3)
            sage: Qcurve([0, 12, 0, 18*(t + 1), 0], guessed_degrees=[2])
            Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 12*x^2 + (18*t+18)*x over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 - 3

        Note that giving no data with regards to the isogenies will
        result in an error::

        r"""Give a splitting character of this Q-curve.

        A splitting character is the character $\eps$ associated to a
        splitting map $\beta$ by $\eps \cdot d = \beta^2$, where $d$
        is the degree map of this Q-curve.

        Although the definition using a splitting map defines a
        splitting character as a galois character, since its fixed
        field is abelian, it can be interpreted as a dirichlet
        character by looking at it as a galois character on
        $\Q(\zeta_n)$. This is the default way of presenting a
        splitting character.

        ALGORITHM:

        To compute the first splitting character, we use the relation
        between splitting characters and the invariant $\xi_\pm$
        computed by :meth:`xi_pm`. The other splitting characters are
        computed using the twist characters computed by
        :meth:`twist_character`.

        INPUT:

          splitting map. Accepted values are non-negative integers
          smaller than the total amount of splitting maps or one of
          the special values: 'all' for a tuple of all splitting
          characters; and 'conjugacy' for a tuple of splitting
          characters, one for each conjugacy class of splitting
          maps. Also accepts tuples of accepted values including
          tuples themselves.

        - ``galois`` -- A boolean (default: False) indicating whether
          the splitting characters should be given as galois or
          dirichlet characters.

        OUTPUT:

        The splitting character of the given index, given as a
        galois character if galois is set to True or as a Dirichlet
        character otherwise. If the index was 'all' or 'conjugacy'
        will return a tuple of such characters corresponding to the
        corresponding tuple of indices. If the given index was a tuple
        will return a tuple of outputs on each entry of this tuple in

        The conductor of an abelian variety associated to a newform is
        $N^n$, where $N$ is the level of the newform and $n$ is the
        dimension of the variety. If the Q-curve decomposes, the

        twisting a newform and the conductor of the restriction of

    def newform(self, algorithm='magma', verify=0):
        r"""Give a newform associated to this Q-curve.

        Each non-CM Q-curve is the quotient of a $\Q$-simple variety
        of GL_2-type, which in turn is isogeneous to an abelian
        variety associated to a newform. We will call such a newform a
        newform associated to a Q-curve.

        ALGORITHM:

        To obtain the newforms we take the restriction of scalars of
        this Q-curve over its decomposition field. If all is well,
        this is isogenous to a product of $\Q$-simple, non
        $\Q$-isogenous abelian varieties of GL_2-type. The newforms
        attached to these varieties are twists of one another,
        allowing the computation of their possible levels by using
        formulas linking the levels of twisted newforms, the conductor
        of the restriction of scalars and the conductor of the abelian
        varieties.
        
        Next for each possible combination of levels, the space of
        newforms of the lowest level is computed with the appropiate
        character. For these newforms the L-series of this Q-curve and
        the L-series of the newforms are compared until as many
        newforms are left as expected. Some Q-curves have multiple
        factors of the same level and character, so one is chosen.

        INPUT:
        
        - ``algorithm`` -- A string that determines which program
          should be used to do computations. Allowed values are:
          'magma' (default) or 'sage' to use MAGMA and Sage
          respectively.  This program is used for computing newforms
          and Euler factors of the L-series associated to the curve.

        - ``verify`` -- A non-negative integer determining what the
          biggest prime is for which the result should be verified
          using the Euler factors of the L-series.

        OUTPUT:

        A tuple consisting of

        - a newform such that this curve is a quotient of the abelian
          variety associated to that newform, i.e. a newform
          associated to this Q-curve by modularity

        - A list of Dirichlet characters that twist this newform into
          other newforms, such that the restriction of scalars of this
          Q-curve over the decomposition field is isogenous (over
          $\Q$) to the product of the abelian varieties associated to
          the twists of the first newform by the given characters.

        .. NOTE::
        
        The newforms associated to a Q-curve are in no way unique. Not
        only are all their galois conjugates also associated, also
        twists of the newform are associated to the same curve. On the
        other hand, all curves isogenous to this Q-curve are
        associated to the same collection of newforms.
